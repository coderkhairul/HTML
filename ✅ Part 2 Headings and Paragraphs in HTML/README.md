# 📘 Part 2: Headings and Paragraphs in HTML

## 🧠 What are Headings?
HTML provides **6 levels of headings**: `<h1>` to `<h6>`.  
- `<h1>` is the **most important** heading.  
- `<h6>` is the **least important**.

Headings help to organize content hierarchically and improve accessibility and SEO.

## 🧠 What is a Paragraph?
The `<p>` tag defines **paragraphs** of text.  
It breaks the text into readable blocks and improves the structure of the content.
