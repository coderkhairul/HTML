### 🔹 Basic Structure of an HTML Document

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  <p>This is my first HTML page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

| `<h1>`           | A heading tag (largest level)                                  |
| `<p>`            | A paragraph of text                                             |
